## 1 Building
You need have a Unix environment with bash, plus Lua, GD tools (specifically,
png2gd) and 7z in order to build the HUD. If you have none of this, you can't
build it at the moment.

After installing all required tools, edit 'make.sh' so that the environment
variables it sets have the correct locations.

## 2 Using
Extract all the contents of the distributed package somewhere you like. Open a
supported ROM in Gens, then start 'mw4-hud.lua'.

## 3 Changelog

* Forked from sonic-gens-hud.
